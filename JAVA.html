    Java is celebrating its 24th birthday this year and has been one
    of the most popular programming languages used for developing 
    server-side applications. Java is a practical choice for
    developing Android apps as it can be used to create highly
    functional programs and platforms. 
This object-oriented programming language does not require 
a specific hardware infrastructure, is easily manageable, 
and has a good level of security. Moreover, it is easier to
learn Java in comparison to languages such as C and C++. 
No wonder, nearly 90 percent of Fortune 500 firms rely on
Java for their desktop applications and backend development projects</font></p>
