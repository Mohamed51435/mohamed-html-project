    Python continues to be one of the best programming languages every developer should learn this year.
     The language is easy-to-learn and offers a clean and well-structured code, making it powerful enough
     to build a decent web application. Python can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based
     desktop applications, machine learning, data science, and network servers. The programming language
     enjoys immense community support and offers several open-source libraries, frameworks, and modules 
     that make application development a cakewalk.For instance, Python offers Django and Flask, popular
     libraries for web development and TensorFlow, Keras, and SciPy for data science applications. 
     Though Python has been around for a while, it makes sense to learn this language in 2020 as it can 
     help you get a job or a freelance project quickly, thereby accelerating your career growth.
